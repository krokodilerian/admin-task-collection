Basically, it should look like this:

~~~~~~sh
#!/bin/bash

DST=/tmp/adsf
mkdir -p $DST

(while /bin/true ; do
	read usr
	if [ -z "$usr" ]; then
		break
	fi

	if `echo "$usr" |grep -q '/'`; then
		echo INVALID SYBOLS IN "$usr"
		continue
	fi

	mkdir -v -p "$DST/$usr"
	cp -a skel "$dst/$usr"
	chown -R bin.bin "$dst/$usr"

done) <userlist
~~~~~~

The parameters need to be quoted, AND / is not an allowed symbol. It can also be done by filtering everything that's not in [A-Za-z0-9], based on the solvee's discretion.
