# A collection of tasks for sysadmins

This started from a list of tasks you give a sysadmin in a job interview, but a lot of people found it fun.

I have tried to keep it to things I've encountered in my job(s), or things close to those.

## How to build

## Structure

Every directory has at least four files:
* `task` is a description of the task (what the interviewee sees)
* `solutiona` is how this can be solved
* `rationale` is why this task is there
* `build.sh` builds the task itself.
